		<h1>Paul Fig</h1>
		<h2>Novice Web Developer</h2>

		<p>Hi, my name is Paul, and I have decided to try my hand at Web Development.</p>

		<p>I was previously involved in the Music Industry. I played drums in a touring rock band for about 5 years and transitioned to the tech side (so I could actually get paid) before Corona put a halt to just about everything. I'd say it's ironic, but it's not. It's just unfortunate.</p>

		<p>I am now pursuing an alternate career path, because who knows when live music is coming back. The internet, however, isn't going anywhere. I've also had an interest in coding/programming, but I never pursued it. Now I have nothing but time, so I may as well learn a new skill.</p>
